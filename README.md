The ultimate goal of this class is to give you practical knowledge and skills to be able to solve real-world big data storage and management problems, so the final project is an opportunity for you to gain more experience working with your favorite NoSQL database. You should work as a team to create a working system and demonstrate it during in-class project presentation. Your system should consist of the following components: 

•	NoSQL database as a back-end storing (preferably) real or artificially generated data; 
•	Graphical or Web interface-based front-end; 
•	Business logic, including data manipulation and analytical (Map-Reduce or Gremlin queries over the data stored in NoSQL database) operations that can be started via the UI and the output of which can be viewed via the UI. 

The data you will use to populate the database. Some of the good candidates are Wikipedia, Freebase and DBpedia. Please see examples in the class book on how to populate a database with the data from those resources. You are also free to use any other resource of your choice or write a script to generate synthetic data. 

Functionality over this data that your interface will provide (retrieval based on queries, CRUD or analytical operations). Include specific use cases that will clearly illustrate the functionality of your application. Please make sure that you propose the functionality that you will be able to implement, given the time that you will have to work on this project.
